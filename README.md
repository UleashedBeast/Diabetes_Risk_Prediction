# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model for diabetes prediction using the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States.

## Project Description

The BRFSS Survey Data and Documentation for 2021 is a valuable source of information on health risk factors and related behaviors in the population. In this project, we utilize this dataset to develop a diabetes prediction model.

The project is divided into the following stages:

1. **Data Exploration**: We conduct in-depth data exploration, analyzing the different available features, identifying relevant relationships and patterns, and understanding the distribution of the target variable (diabetes).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We perform data preprocessing to ensure data quality and prepare it for modeling. This includes data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.

3. **Modeling and Evaluation**: We employ Machine Learning techniques to train and evaluate various diabetes prediction models. We explore algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and other ensemble-based models.

4. **Analysis and Interpretation of Results**: We analyze the model results and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics for classification problems. We interpret the most relevant features and understand how they contribute to diabetes prediction.

5. **Documentation and Sharing of Results**: We provide clear documentation on the project, including instructions for running the code, a description of the features used in the model, and the key findings. Additionally, we share the code and data in a GitHub repository to make them available and accessible to other interested users.
