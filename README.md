# Risk prediction for diabetes
This project is a part of the Data Science Working Group at Code for CoderHouse DataScience Course.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is generate a ML stacking model that predict the risk of diabetes on a certain population, also, we what to show diferent habilities in data science, such us Mining, Wrangling, Cleaning, Dataset description, ML training, ML analisis.

To identify risk factors for a number of human diseases, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched in 1984 the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), an ongoing, statewide, randomized telephone survey for non-institutionalized adults 18 years and older.

The BRFSS Dataset is Public

We accessed publicly available 2021 BRFSS data, containing 279 variables across 464,644 topics (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html). Of these records, 61,118 respondents had been diagnosed with diabetes, 12,699 had been diagnosed with prediabetes, and 390,827 had neither diabetes nor prediabetes. Most of the 279 variables were associated with chronic health conditions other than diabetes (eg, cancer, asthma). A respondent was considered to have type 2 diabetes if they were over the age of 30, not pregnant, and answered yes to the question "Have you ever been told you have diabetes?"
